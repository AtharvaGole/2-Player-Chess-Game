Libraries Used:
pygame

Features:
1. All the types of legal moves as well as Check, Checkmate, Stalemate and Castelling are present in the game.
2. When a player clicks on a piece then all the valid moves of that piece are displayed on the chess board.

How to run the program:
Python 3.5 nad pygame must be installed in your computer. 
Copy the code in a folder and save it with ".py" extension.
Copy the images in the same folder.
Now, for playing the game simply double-click on the file in which code is present.

About Images:
As I didn't get proper game sprites so I edited a pic containing all the chess pieces and changed there background from white to the color of the chess board. So, I numbered them in a specific manner. So, don't change the names of the images while using them.

Future Work:
The player chess game be made 1 player by either writing a code for it or by using the chess API of python.
Sound can also be added in the game.
